<div id="the-r-environment" class="section level2">
<h2>The R environment</h2>
<p>R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. Among other things it has</p>
<p>an effective data handling and storage facility, a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices, a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis, graphical facilities for data analysis and display either directly at the computer or on hardcopy, and a well developed, simple and effective programming language (called ‘S’) which includes conditionals, loops, user defined recursive functions and input and output facilities. (Indeed most of the system supplied functions are themselves written in the S language.) The term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.</p>
<p>R is very much a vehicle for newly developing methods of interactive data analysis. It has developed rapidly, and has been extended by a large collection of packages. However, most programs written in R are essentially ephemeral, written for a single piece of data analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>What are R and RStudio?</h2>
<p>For much of this book, we will assume that you are using R via RStudio. First time users often confuse the two. At its simplest:</p>
<ul>
<li>R is like a car’s engine.</li>
<li>RStudio is like a car’s dashboard.</li>
</ul>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="center">R: Engine</th>
<th align="center">RStudio: Dashboard</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><img src="img/engine.jpg" style="height:30.0%" /></td>
<td align="center"><img src="img/dashboard.jpg" style="height:20.0%" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>More precisely, R is a programming language that runs computations while RStudio is an <em>integrated development environment (IDE)</em> that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools. So just as the way of having access to a speedometer, rearview mirrors, and a navigation system makes driving much easier, using RStudio’s interface makes using R much easier as well.</p>
<p>RStudio is currently a very popular way to not only write your R scripts but also to interact with the R software. To function correctly, RStudio needs R and therefore both need to be installed on your computer.</p>
<p>If you are still not sure about the difference between R and RStudio IDE, we suggest you watch this <a href="https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-the-rstudio-ide-part-1/orientation?ex=1">DataCamp video</a>.</p>
<div id="installing-r-and-rstudio" class="section level3">
<h3>Installing R and RStudio</h3>
<p>You will first need to download and install both R and RStudio (Desktop version) on your computer.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>You must do this first:</strong> <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">Download and install R</a>.
<ul>
<li>Click on the download link corresponding to your computer’s operating system.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>You must do this second:</strong> <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/">Download and install RStudio</a>.
<ul>
<li>Scroll down to “Installers for Supported Platforms”</li>
<li>Click on the download link corresponding to your computer’s operating system.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>If you had trouble with these two steps, we suggest you watch this <a href="https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-the-rstudio-ide-part-1/orientation?ex=3">DataCamp video</a>.</p>

<div id="why-learn-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Why learn R?</h2>
<div id="r-does-not-involve-lots-of-pointing-and-clicking-and-thats-a-good-thing" class="section level4">
<h4>R does not involve lots of pointing and clicking, and that’s a good thing</h4>
<p>The learning curve might be steeper than with other software, but with R, the results of your analysis do not rely on remembering a succession of pointing and clicking, but instead on a series of written commands, and that’s a good thing! So, if you want to redo your analysis because you collected more data, you don’t have to remember which button you clicked in which order to obtain your results; you just have to run your script again.</p>
<p>Working with scripts makes the steps you used in your analysis clear, and the code you write can be inspected by someone else who can give you feedback and spot mistakes.</p>
<p>Working with scripts forces you to have a deeper understanding of what you are doing, and facilitates your learning and comprehension of the methods you use.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-code-is-great-for-reproducibility" class="section level4">
<h4>R code is great for reproducibility</h4>
<p>Reproducibility is when someone else (including your future self) can obtain the same results from the same dataset when using the same analysis.</p>
<p>R integrates with other tools to generate manuscripts from your code. If you collect more data, or fix a mistake in your dataset, the figures and the statistical tests in your manuscript are updated automatically.</p>
<p>An increasing number of journals and funding agencies expect analyses to be reproducible, so knowing R will give you an edge with these requirements.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-is-interdisciplinary-and-extensible" class="section level4">
<h4>R is interdisciplinary and extensible</h4>
<p>With 10,000+ packages that can be installed to extend its capabilities, R provides a framework that allows you to combine statistical approaches from many scientific disciplines to best suit the analytical framework you need to analyze your data. For instance, R has packages for image analysis, GIS, time series, population genetics, and a lot more.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-works-on-data-of-all-shapes-and-sizes" class="section level4">
<h4>R works on data of all shapes and sizes</h4>
<p>The skills you learn with R scale easily with the size of your dataset. Whether your dataset has hundreds or millions of lines, it won’t make much difference to you.</p>
<p>R is designed for data analysis. It comes with special data structures and data types that make handling of missing data and statistical factors convenient.</p>
<p>R can connect to spreadsheets, databases, and many other data formats, on your computer or on the web.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-produces-high-quality-graphics" class="section level4">
<h4>R produces high-quality graphics</h4>
<p>The plotting functionalities in R are endless, and allow you to adjust any aspect of your graph to convey most effectively the message from your data.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-has-a-large-and-welcoming-community" class="section level4">
<h4>R has a large and welcoming community</h4>
<p>Thousands of people use R daily. Many of them are willing to help you through mailing lists and websites such as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, or on the <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/">RStudio community</a>.</p>
</div>

<h4>Not only is R free, but it is also open-source and cross-platform</h4>
<p>Anyone can inspect the source code to see how R works. Because of this transparency, there is less chance for mistakes, and if you (or someone else) find some, you can report and fix bugs.</p>

<h2>Knowing your way around RStudio</h2>
<p>Let’s start by learning about <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, which is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for working with R.</p>
<p>The RStudio IDE open-source product is free under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3</a>. The RStudio IDE is also available with a commercial license and priority email support from RStudio, Inc.</p>
<p>We will use RStudio IDE to write code, navigate the files on our computer, inspect the variables we are going to create, and visualize the plots we will generate. RStudio can also be used for other things (e.g., version control, developing packages, writing Shiny apps) that we will not cover during the workshop.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/rstudio-screenshot.png" alt="RStudio interface screenshot. Clockwise from top left: Source, Environment/History, Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer, Console." />
<p class="caption">RStudio interface screenshot. Clockwise from top left: Source, Environment/History, Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer, Console.</p>
</div>
<p>RStudio is divided into 4 “Panes”: the <strong>Source</strong> for your scripts and documents (top-left, in the default layout), your <strong>Environment/History</strong> (top-right), your <strong>Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer</strong> (bottom-right), and the R <strong>Console</strong> (bottom-left). The placement of these panes and their content can be customized (see menu, Tools -&gt; Global Options -&gt; Pane Layout).</p>
<p>One of the advantages of using RStudio is that all the information you need to write code is available in a single window. Additionally, with many shortcuts, autocompletion, and highlighting for the major file types you use while developing in R, RStudio will make typing easier and less error-prone.</p>

<div id="interacting-with-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Interacting with R</h2>
<div id="r-console" class="section level3">
<h3>R Console</h3>
<p>The basis of programming is that we write down instructions for the computer to follow, and then we tell the computer to follow those instructions. We write, or <em>code</em>, instructions in R because it is a common language that both the computer and we can understand. We call the instructions <em>commands</em> and we tell the computer to follow the instructions by <em>executing</em> (also called <em>running</em>) those commands.</p>
<p>There are two main ways of interacting with R: by using the console or by using script files (plain text files that contain your code). The console pane (in RStudio, the bottom left panel) is the place where commands written in the R language can be typed and executed immediately by the computer. It is also where the results will be shown for commands that have been executed. You can type commands directly into the console and press <code>Enter</code> to execute those commands, but they will be forgotten when you close the session.</p>
<p>If R is ready to accept commands, the R console shows a <code>&gt;</code> prompt. If it receives a command (by typing, copy-pasting or sent from the script editor using <kbd><code>Ctrl</code></kbd> + <kbd><code>Enter</code></kbd>), R will try to execute it, and when ready, will show the results and come back with a new <code>&gt;</code> prompt to wait for new commands.</p>
<p>If R is still waiting for you to enter more data because it isn’t complete yet, the console will show a <code>+</code> prompt. It means that you haven’t finished entering a complete command. This is because you have not ‘closed’ a parenthesis or quotation, i.e. you don’t have the same number of left-parentheses as right-parentheses, or the same number of opening and closing quotation marks. When this happens, and you thought you finished typing your command, click inside the console window and press <kbd><code>Esc</code></kbd>; this will cancel the incomplete command and return you to the <code>&gt;</code> prompt.</p>
</div>
<div id="coding-basics" class="section level3">
<h3>Coding basics</h3>
<p>Let’s review some basics we’ve so far omitted in the interests of getting you plotting as quickly as possible. You can use R as a calculator:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="dv">1</span> <span class="op">/</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">200</span> <span class="op">*</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">30</span>
(<span class="dv">59</span> <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">73</span> <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">2</span>) <span class="op">/</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">3</span>
<span class="kw">sin</span>(pi <span class="op">/</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">2</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>You can create new objects with <code>&lt;-</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">x &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">3</span> <span class="op">*</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">4</span></code></pre></div>
<p>All R statements where you create objects, <strong>assignment</strong> statements, have the same form:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">object_name &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>value</code></pre></div>
<p>When reading that code say “object name gets value” in your head.</p>
<p>You will make lots of assignments and <code>&lt;-</code> is a pain to type. Don’t be lazy and use <code>=</code>: it will work, but it will cause confusion later. Instead, use RStudio’s keyboard shortcut: Alt + - (the minus sign). Notice that RStudio automagically surrounds <code>&lt;-</code> with spaces, which is a good code formatting practice. Code is miserable to read on a good day, so giveyoureyesabreak and use spaces.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-scripts" class="section level3">
<h3>R Scripts</h3>
<p>So far you’ve been using the console to run code. That’s a great place to start. However, because we want our code and workflow to be reproducible, it is better to type the commands we want in the script editor, and save the script. This way, there is a complete record of what we did, and anyone (including our future selves!) can easily replicate the results on their computer.</p>
<p>The script editor is a great place to put code you care about. Keep experimenting in the console, but once you have written code that works and does what you want, put it in the script editor. RStudio will automatically save the contents of the editor when you quit RStudio, and will automatically load it when you re-open. Nevertheless, it’s a good idea to save your scripts regularly and to back them up.</p>
<p>RStudio allows you to execute commands directly from the script editor by using the <kbd><code>Ctrl</code></kbd> + <kbd><code>Enter</code></kbd> shortcut (on Macs, <kbd><code>Cmd</code></kbd> + <kbd><code>Return</code></kbd> will work, too). The command on the current line in the script (indicated by the cursor) or all of the commands in the currently selected text will be sent to the console and executed when you press <kbd><code>Ctrl</code></kbd> + <kbd><code>Enter</code></kbd>. You can find other keyboard shortcuts in this <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf">RStudio cheatsheet about the RStudio IDE</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="errors-warnings-and-messages" class="section level3">
<h3>Errors, warnings, and messages</h3>
<p>One slightly confusing part of R is how it reports errors, warnings, and messages. The default theme in RStudio colors errors, warnings, and messages in red, which makes them seem like you did something wrong. However, seeing red text in the console <em>is not always bad.</em></p>
<p>R will show red text in the console in three different situations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Errors</strong>: When the red text is a legitimate error, it will be prefaced with “Error in…” and try to explain what went wrong. Generally when there’s an error, the code will not run. For example, as shown in Subsection @ref(package-use) below if you see <code>Error in ggplot(...) : could not find function &quot;ggplot&quot;</code>, it means that the <code>ggplot()</code> function is not accessible because the package was not loaded with <code>library(ggplot2)</code>, and thus you cannot use it.</li>
<li><strong>Warnings</strong>: When the red text is a warning, it will be prefaced with “Warning:” and try to explain why there’s a warning. Generally your code will still work, but with some caveats. For example, you see in Chapter @ref(viz) if you plot a scatterplot and one of the rows in your data frame is missing a value, you will see this warning: <code>Warning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (geom_point)</code>. R will still make the scatterplot with all the remaining values, but it’s warning you that one of the points isn’t there.</li>
<li><strong>Messages</strong>: When the red text doesn’t start with either “Error” or “Warning”, it’s <em>just a friendly message</em>. You’ll see these messages when you load some packages like the <code>dplyr</code> package in Subsection @ref(package-loading) below, or when you read data saved in spreadsheet files with <code>read_csv()</code> as you’ll see in Chapter @ref(tidy). These are helpful diagnostic messages and they don’t stop your code from working.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, when you see red text in the console, <em>don’t panic</em>. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the text starts with “Error”, figure out what’s causing it. <span style="color:red">Think of errors as a red traffic light: something is wrong!</span></li>
<li>If the text starts with “Warning”, figure out if it’s something to worry about. For instance, if you get a warning about missing values in a scatterplot and you know there are missing values, you’re fine. If that’s surprising, look at your data and see what’s missing. <span style="color:gold">Think of warnings as a yellow traffic light: everything is working fine, but watch out/pay attention.</span></li>
<li>Otherwise the text is just a message. Read it, wave back at R, and thank it for talking to you. <span style="color:green">Think of messages as a green traffic light: everything is working fine.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="packages" class="section level3">
<h3>R packages</h3>
<p>Another point of confusion with many new R users is the idea of an R package. R packages extend the functionality of R by providing additional functions, data, and documentation. They are written by a world-wide community of R users and can be downloaded for free from the internet. For example, among the many packages we will use in this book are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>ggplot2</code> package for data visualization in Chapter @ref(viz).</li>
<li>The <code>dplyr</code> package for data wrangling in Chapter @ref(wrangling).</li>
<li>The <code>moderndive</code> package that accompanies this book.</li>
<li>The <code>infer</code> package for “tidy” and transparent statistical inference in Chapters @ref(confidence-intervals), @ref(hypothesis-testing), and @ref(inference-for-regression).</li>
</ul>
<p>A good analogy for R packages is they are like apps you can download onto a mobile phone:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="center">R: A new phone</th>
<th align="center">R Packages: Apps you can download</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><img src="img/iphone.jpg" style="height:10.0%" /></td>
<td align="center"><img src="img/apps.jpg" style="height:20.0%" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So R is like a new mobile phone: while it has a certain amount of features when you use it for the first time, it doesn’t have everything. R packages are like the apps you can download onto your phone from Apple’s App Store or Android’s Google Play.</p>
<p>Let’s continue this analogy by considering the Instagram app for editing and sharing pictures. Say you have purchased a new phone and you would like to share a recent photo you have taken on Instagram. You need to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Install the app</em>: Since your phone is new and does not include the Instagram app, you need to download the app from either the App Store or Google Play. You do this once and you’re set. You might do this again in the future any time there is an update to the app.</li>
<li><em>Open the app</em>: After you’ve installed Instagram, you need to open the app.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once Instagram is open on your phone, you can then proceed to share your photo with your friends and family. The process is very similar for using an R package. You need to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Install the package</em>: This is like installing an app on your phone. Most packages are not installed by default when you install R and RStudio. Thus if you want to use a package for the first time, you need to install it first. Once you’ve installed a package, you likely won’t install it again unless you want to update it to a newer version.</li>
<li><em>“Load” the package</em>: “Loading” a package is like opening an app on your phone. Packages are not “loaded” by default when you start RStudio on your computer; you need to “load” each package you want to use every time you start RStudio.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s now show you how to perform these two steps for the <code>ggplot2</code> package for data visualization.</p>
<div id="package-installation" class="section level4">
<h4>Package installation</h4>
<p>There are two ways to install an R package. For example, to install the <code>ggplot2</code> package:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Easy way</strong>: In the Files pane of RStudio:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Click on the “Packages” tab</li>
<li>Click on “Install”</li>
<li>Type the name of the package under “Packages (separate multiple with space or comma):” In this case, type <code>ggplot2</code></li>
<li>Click “Install”<br />
<img src="images/install_packages_easy_way.png" height="384" /></li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Slightly harder way</strong>: An alternative but slightly less convenient way to install a package is by typing <code>install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;)</code> in the Console pane of RStudio and hitting enter. Note you must include the quotation marks.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="package-loading" class="section level4">
<h4>Package loading</h4>
<p>Recall that after you’ve installed a package, you need to “load” it, in other words open it. We do this by using the <code>library()</code> command. For example, to load the <code>ggplot2</code> package, run the following code in the Console pane. What do we mean by “run the following code”? Either type or copy &amp; paste the following code into the Console pane and then hit the enter key.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">library</span>(ggplot2)</code></pre></div>
<p>If after running the above code, a blinking cursor returns next to the <code>&gt;</code> “prompt” sign, it means you were successful and the <code>ggplot2</code> package is now loaded and ready to use. If however, you get a red “error message” that reads…</p>
<pre><code>Error in library(ggplot2) : there is no package called ‘ggplot2’</code></pre>
<p>… it means that you didn’t successfully install it. In that case, go back to the previous subsection “Package installation” and install it.</p>
</div>
<div id="package-use" class="section level4">
<h4>Package use</h4>
<p>One extremely common mistake new R users make when wanting to use particular packages is they forget to “load” them first by using the <code>library()</code> command we just saw. Remember: <em>you have to load each package you want to use every time you start RStudio.</em> If you don’t first “load” a package, but attempt to use one of its features, you’ll see an error message similar to:</p>
<pre><code>Error: could not find function</code></pre>
<p>R is telling you that you are trying to use a function in a package that has not yet been “loaded.” Almost all new users forget do this when starting out, and it is a little annoying to get used. However, you’ll remember with practice.</p>

<div id="tips-on-learning-to-code" class="section level3">
<h3>Tips on learning to code</h3>
<p>Learning to code/program is very much like learning a foreign language, it can be very daunting and frustrating at first. Such frustrations are very common and it is very normal to feel discouraged as you learn. However just as with learning a foreign language, if you put in the effort and are not afraid to make mistakes, anybody can learn.</p>
<p>Here are a few useful tips to keep in mind as you learn to program:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remember that computers are not actually that smart</strong>: You may think your computer or smartphone are “smart,” but really people spent a lot of time and energy designing them to appear “smart.” Rather you have to tell a computer everything it needs to do. Furthermore the instructions you give your computer can’t have any mistakes in them, nor can they be ambiguous in any way.</li>
<li><strong>Take the “copy, paste, and tweak” approach</strong>: Especially when learning your first programming language, it is often much easier to taking existing code that you know works and modify it to suit your ends, rather than trying to write new code from scratch. We call this the <em>copy, paste, and tweak</em> approach. So early on, we suggest not trying to write code from memory, but rather take existing examples we have provided you, then copy, paste, and tweak them to suit your goals. Don’t be afraid to play around!</li>
<li><strong>The best way to learn to code is by doing</strong>: Rather than learning to code for its own sake, we feel that learning to code goes much smoother when you have a goal in mind or when you are working on a particular project, like analyzing data that you are interested in.</li>
<li><strong>Practice is key</strong>: Just as the only method to improving your foreign language skills is through practice, practice, and practice; so also the only method to improving your coding is through practice, practice, and practice. Don’t worry however; we’ll give you plenty of opportunities to do so!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Seeking help</h2>
<div id="use-the-built-in-rstudio-help-interface-to-search-for-more-information-on-r-functions" class="section level4">
<h4>Use the built-in RStudio help interface to search for more information on R functions</h4>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/rstudiohelp.png" alt="RStudio help interface." />
<p class="caption">RStudio help interface.</p>
</div>
<p>One of the fastest ways to get help, is to use the RStudio help interface. This panel by default can be found at the lower right hand panel of RStudio. As seen in the screenshot, by typing the word “Mean”, RStudio tries to also give a number of suggestions that you might be interested in. The description is then shown in the display window.</p>
</div>
<div id="i-know-the-name-of-the-function-i-want-to-use-but-im-not-sure-how-to-use-it" class="section level4">
<h4>I know the name of the function I want to use, but I’m not sure how to use it</h4>
<p>If you need help with a specific function, let’s say <code>barplot()</code>, you can type:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">?barplot</code></pre></div>
<p>If you just need to remind yourself of the names of the arguments, you can use:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">args</span>(lm)</code></pre></div>
</div>
<div id="i-want-to-use-a-function-that-does-x-there-must-be-a-function-for-it-but-i-dont-know-which-one" class="section level4">
<h4>I want to use a function that does X, there must be a function for it but I don’t know which one…</h4>
<p>If you are looking for a function to do a particular task, you can use the <code>help.search()</code> function, which is called by the double question mark <code>??</code>. However, this only looks through the installed packages for help pages with a match to your search request</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">??kruskal</code></pre></div>
<p>If you can’t find what you are looking for, you can use the <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org">rdocumentation.org</a> website that searches through the help files across all packages available.</p>
<p>Finally, a generic Google or internet search “R &lt;task&gt;” will often either send you to the appropriate package documentation or a helpful forum where someone else has already asked your question.</p>
</div>
<div id="i-am-stuck-i-get-an-error-message-that-i-dont-understand" class="section level4">
<h4>I am stuck… I get an error message that I don’t understand</h4>
<p>Start by googling the error message. However, this doesn’t always work very well because often, package developers rely on the error catching provided by R. You end up with general error messages that might not be very helpful to diagnose a problem (e.g. “subscript out of bounds”). If the message is very generic, you might also include the name of the function or package you’re using in your query.</p>
<p>However, you should check Stack Overflow. Search using the <code>[r]</code> tag. Most questions have already been answered, but the challenge is to use the right words in the search to find the answers: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r" class="uri">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r</a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf">Introduction to R</a> can also be dense for people with little programming experience but it is a good place to understand the underpinnings of the R language.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html">R FAQ</a> is dense and technical but it is full of useful information.</p>
